### Philosophy

We adhere to the doctrine of [Choose Boring Technology](http://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology). 
This is done mostly out of a need for project sanity; if development, 
packaging, and deployment get too complex, we risk being labeled as an
"Experts only" project, reducing adoption and hampering forward motion.

We expect 100% test coverage. While we understand that this does not 
necessarily guarantee good tests, it does force a contributing engineer to 
think through edge cases in a way that might otherwise be skipped.

### Secure by Default
